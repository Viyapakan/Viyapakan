I played a crucial role in various aspects of the project:

- **Planning:** Actively participated in detailed discussions and brainstorming sessions to shape the project concept. 
Contributed ideas on functionality, design, and materials selection.
- **Material Selection:** Played a key role in choosing recyclable materials, ensuring the environmental sustainability of our project. 
This decision involved careful consideration of the materials' durability and eco-friendliness.
- **Manufacturing and Welding:** Contributed the manufacturing and welding processes, overseeing the construction of the BBQ machine. 
Utilized my expertise in welding to ensure the structural integrity and safety of the product.
- **Finishing Touches:** Worked on the finishing parts of the machine, paying attention to the aesthetics and user experience. 
Contributed to the final assembly and ensured that every component worked seamlessly together.
- **Logo Design:** Designed the project logo, incorporating our team's vision and identity into the sticker. 
The logo became a symbol of our hard work and creativity, representing our team in a unique way.

### Achievements

Our dedication and collaborative effort resulted in winning the **1st Runner-Up** position in the overall competition. 
This achievement not only recognized our innovative BBQ machine but also acknowledged our teamwork, problem-solving skills, and creativity.

### Learning Experience

This project was a significant learning experience for me. It enhanced my:

- **Mechanical Designing Skills:** Through hands-on experience and problem-solving, I honed my skills in designing functional and innovative mechanical systems.

## Project 02: Robofest 2023 - SLIIT ü§ñ

I led a team of five members in the Robofest 2023 competition organized by SLIIT (Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology). 
Our project involved creating a wall-following obstacle-avoiding robot, a challenge that pushed the boundaries of our creativity and technical expertise.

### Project Overview

#### Challenge: Wall-Following Obstacle-Avoiding Robot
- **Objective:** Develop a robot capable of navigating along walls while avoiding obstacles in its path.

### My Leadership and Contributions

In this high-pressure environment, I assumed a leadership role and spearheaded the entire project. My contributions included:

- **Project Planning:** Developed a comprehensive plan outlining the project scope, milestones, and tasks breakdown. Devised a strategic approach to tackle the challenge efficiently.
- **Component Selection:** Carefully selected suitable components, including motors, sensors, and microcontrollers, considering compatibility and performance requirements.
- **Coding and Algorithms:** Personally handled the coding aspects, implementing algorithms for wall-following and obstacle avoidance. 
  Wrote optimized code to ensure precise movements and timely responses to sensor inputs.
- **Sensor Selection:** Chose appropriate sensors and integrated them into the robot's design. Implemented sensor fusion techniques to enhance accuracy in detecting obstacles and walls.

### Intense Dedication and Sleepless Nights

The project presented a unique challenge as we started from scratch with only a week to deliver a functional robot. 
During this time, I faced a daunting task: transforming our initial plans into a working prototype. With guidance from a senior mentor, I dedicated five sleepless days and nights to the project.

### Valuable Learning Experience

Despite our elimination in the competition, the experience was invaluable. It taught me:

- **Time Management:** Mastered the art of managing time effectively under extreme pressure, delivering a functional product within a tight deadline.
- **Problem-Solving:** Enhanced my problem-solving skills, finding creative solutions to technical challenges that arose during the development process.
- **Leadership:** Strengthened my leadership abilities by guiding the team through intense periods of work, maintaining motivation, and ensuring everyone stayed focused on our goal.

### Conclusion

Robofest 2023 marked the beginning of my journey in the field of robotics. Although we faced setbacks, the experience was transformative. It ignited my passion for robotics and automation, 
motivating me to explore further and participate in more challenging projects in the future.
The sleepless nights and the challenges we faced are now cherished memories, reminding me of the determination and resilience required in the world of robotics.
