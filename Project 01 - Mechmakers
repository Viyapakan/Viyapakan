- **Planning:** Actively participated in detailed discussions and brainstorming sessions to shape the project concept. 
Contributed ideas on functionality, design, and materials selection.
- **Material Selection:** Played a key role in choosing recyclable materials, ensuring the environmental sustainability of our project. 
This decision involved careful consideration of the materials' durability and eco-friendliness.
- **Manufacturing and Welding:** Contributed the manufacturing and welding processes, overseeing the construction of the BBQ machine. 
Utilized my expertise in welding to ensure the structural integrity and safety of the product.
- **Finishing Touches:** Worked on the finishing parts of the machine, paying attention to the aesthetics and user experience. 
Contributed to the final assembly and ensured that every component worked seamlessly together.
- **Logo Design:** Designed the project logo, incorporating our team's vision and identity into the sticker. 
The logo became a symbol of our hard work and creativity, representing our team in a unique way.
